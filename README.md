Tic Tac Toe Game  
A classic, fully responsive Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has a clean design that focuses on smooth gameplay and a scalable interface that works on any device.  

About The Project  
This project was created to show basic web development skills, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and modern CSS for responsive design.
The game logic runs entirely on the client side, making it fast and lightweight. 
The visual theme draws inspiration from a dark, vintage style, offering a unique user experience.
